# üìò Serverless Cloud Dictionary Application

---

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates a **serverless application on AWS** that allows users to search and store definitions of cloud-related terms.  
It eliminates the need for traditional server hosting by leveraging AWS‚Äôs fully managed services, making the solution **scalable, cost-effective, and highly available**.

The application provides a simple **React-based frontend** hosted on **AWS Amplify**, which communicates with a **serverless backend** powered by **API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB**.

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Used

| Service               | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Amplify**       | Hosts the React frontend application                                |
| **Amazon API Gateway**| Manages RESTful API endpoints between frontend and backend services  |
| **AWS Lambda**        | Handles API requests for fetching and adding dictionary terms       |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**   | Stores dictionary terms and their definitions in a NoSQL database   |
| **IAM Roles & Policies** | Ensures secure, least-privilege access across all AWS services |

## üîÅ Project Workflow

1. **User Interaction via Frontend**  
   - User searches or adds terms through the React application hosted on Amplify.  
2. **API Gateway Request**  
   - API Gateway exposes secure REST endpoints and forwards the request to Lambda.  
3. **Lambda Function Execution**  
   - Lambda retrieves existing definitions or inserts new terms into DynamoDB.  
4. **Database Storage in DynamoDB**  
   - All dictionary terms and their definitions are stored in DynamoDB.  
5. **Response to Frontend**  
   - The processed result is returned to the frontend for display.
